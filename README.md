# CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery

Author: Mikhail Khoroshavin aka "XopMC"

`CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery` is a focused CUDA tool for one very specific job: recover incomplete BIP39 mnemonic phrases quickly, validate them against real targets, and keep the workflow clear enough to trust in a real recovery session.

It is built for practical recovery work: real wildcard templates, real derivation lists, real filters, real multi-GPU runs, and output that stays easy to read when a long session is finally producing hits.

## Why This Tool Exists

- You have a real mnemonic backup with missing words marked as `*`.
- You want to validate candidates against exact hashes, Bloom filters, or XOR filters instead of scrolling through noise.
- You want one tool that can check Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and TON-oriented targets from the same recovery flow.
- You want multi-GPU support in a focused, easy-to-follow recovery workflow.

## Highlights

- Recover missing BIP39 words with `*` wildcards.
- Work with mnemonic lengths from `3` to `48` words, as long as the phrase length is a multiple of `3`.
- Use embedded BIP39 wordlists or force an external `-wordlist FILE`.
- Auto-pick the matching BIP39 language wordlist and correct common word-entry typos when the intended word is clear.
- Feed templates inline or from files.
- Check candidates against exact `-hash`, Bloom filters, XOR filters, and optional CPU-side verification.
- Build XOR filters with [XorFilter](https://github.com/XopMC/XorFilter) and plug them straight into the recovery flow.
- Select Bitcoin-like, Ethereum, Solana, and TON target families with one CLI.
- Override derivation routing with `-d_type` when wallet behavior does not match the usual coin-native path.
- Run one GPU or several GPUs with the same recovery workflow.
- Keep save/output compact, readable, and practical for long recovery sessions.

## Supported Target Families

`-c` selects which target families are derived and checked.

| Letter | Family | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `c` | Compressed | Bitcoin compressed address / hash160 |
| `u` | Uncompressed | Legacy uncompressed address / hash160 |
| `s` | SegWit | P2SH-wrapped SegWit style output |
| `r` | Taproot | Bech32m taproot output |
| `x` | XPoint | X-only/public point style match |
| `e` | Ethereum | Ethereum address / hash |
| `S` | Solana | Solana public address / raw target |
| `t` | TON | Core TON wallet sweep |
| `T` | TON-all | Extended TON wallet sweep |

Any `-c` letters outside this set are rejected in the public release.

## Build

### Windows with CMake

```powershell
cmake --preset windows-release
cmake --build --preset windows-release --config Release
```

### Windows with Visual Studio

```powershell
msbuild CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

### Linux / WSL

```bash
make configure
make build
```

### Force a local `sm_89` build

cmake --build --preset windows-release --config Release
```

## Prebuilt GitHub Bundles

GitHub Actions is set up to produce two distribution archives:

- `CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery-windows-builds.zip`
- `CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery-linux-builds.tar.gz`

The Linux archive contains these build profiles:

| Profile | Intended cards | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sm_61-dlto` | GTX 10xx / Pascal | Dedicated legacy-friendly Linux build |
| `sm_75-dlto` | RTX 20xx / Turing | Best fit for RTX 20xx on Linux |
| `sm_86-dlto` | RTX 30xx / Ampere | Dedicated Ampere Linux build |
| `sm_89-dlto` | RTX 40xx / Ada | Dedicated Ada Linux build |
| `sm_120-dlto` | RTX 50xx / Blackwell | Dedicated Blackwell Linux build |
| `universal-sm_86-sm_120` | RTX 30xx / 40xx / 50xx | One Linux binary for modern cards from `sm_86` through `sm_120` |

The Windows archive contains these build profiles:

| Profile | Intended cards | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sm_61` | GTX 10xx / Pascal | Dedicated legacy-friendly Windows build |
| `sm_75` | RTX 20xx / Turing | Best fit for RTX 20xx on Windows |
| `sm_86` | RTX 30xx / Ampere | Dedicated Ampere Windows build |
| `sm_89` | RTX 40xx / Ada | Dedicated Ada Windows build |
| `sm_120` | RTX 50xx / Blackwell | Dedicated Blackwell Windows build |
| `universal-sm_86-sm_120` | RTX 30xx / 40xx / 50xx | One Windows binary for modern cards from `sm_86` through `sm_120` |

Release bundles are built with CUDA `12.8`. Pick a dedicated build when you want the best match for one GPU generation, or choose `universal-sm_86-sm_120` when you want one binary for RTX `30xx` through `50xx`. RTX `20xx` remains on the dedicated `sm_75` build.

The packaged binaries are intended to be easy to move between machines. A compatible NVIDIA driver is still required on the target machine.

## Quick Start

The first commands below all use the same bundled exact-hash fixture, so you can reproduce the run as-is on this repository.

### Recover one missing word from the command line

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery "adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny burst *" -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Recover from a file with template lines

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Validate against a real exact hash

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery "* * alert human kiwi rough pottery level * funny burst divorce" -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Recover with an XOR filter

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -xc wallet.xor_c -xx wallet.xor_u -c cus
```

### Recover with passphrases from a file

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -pass examples/passphrases.txt -c e
```

### Check Solana through BTC-style derivation rules

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c S -d_type 1
```

## File Input Formats

### Recovery templates file

Each line is one mnemonic template. Missing words are written as `*`.

Example: [`examples/templates.txt`](./examples/templates.txt)

```text
adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny burst *
adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny * *
```

Rules:

- one template per line
- use spaces between words
- use `*` for every unknown word
- keep the line as a normal mnemonic phrase, only with missing positions replaced
- valid phrase lengths are `3..48` words and must stay divisible by `3`
- the tool auto-detects the matching BIP39 language wordlist
- the parser can correct common typos when the intended BIP39 word is obvious

### Derivations file

Each line is one derivation path.

Example: [`examples/derivations/default.txt`](./examples/derivations/default.txt)

```text
m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
m/49'/0'/0'/0/0
m/84'/0'/0'/0/0
m/86'/0'/0'/0/0
m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
m/44'/501'/0'/0'
m/44'/607'/0'/0/0
```

### Passphrase file

Each line is one passphrase candidate.

Example: [`examples/passphrases.txt`](./examples/passphrases.txt)

```text
TREZOR
wallet-passphrase-example
```

## Command Line Reference

### Recovery sources

| Option | Meaning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-recovery "..."` | Add one template inline | Repeatable |
| `-recovery -i FILE` | Load templates from file | Repeatable |
| `-wordlist FILE` | Override embedded BIP39 wordlist | Must still be a valid 2048-word BIP39 list |
| `-d FILE` | Load derivation paths from file | Required |

### Targets and derivation routing

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-c TYPES` | Target family selection. Default: `cus` |
| `-d_type <1/2/3/4>` | Force derivation engine: `1=bip32-secp256k1`, `2=slip0010-ed25519`, `3=check both`, `4=ed25519-bip32 (experimental)` |

If `-d_type` is omitted, the tool uses the usual derivation style for the selected target family:

- Bitcoin-like and Ethereum targets use the usual BIP32/secp256k1 path
- Solana and TON use their usual ed25519-oriented derivation style
- `-c` still controls the target family that is generated and checked, even when `-d_type` overrides the derivation engine
- `-d_type 4` is available only when requested explicitly and is never included in mixed mode
- Live status shows both `candidates/s` and `hashes/s`; hash throughput grows with derivation count, selected targets, and derivation policy

### Experimental `-d_type 4`

`-d_type 4` keeps the `ed25519-bip32` path available for evaluation work.

- It is opt-in only.
- It is not part of `-d_type 3`.
- It is not part of the main production-path claims in this README.
- Validation coverage for this mode is tracked separately in [`VALIDATION.md`](./VALIDATION.md).

### Filters and direct targets

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-hash HEX` | Match an exact target hash or raw target prefix in hex |
| `-bf FILE` | Load a Bloom filter. Repeatable |
| `-xu FILE` | Load `.xor_u`, the uncompressed XOR filter format. Repeatable |
| `-xc FILE` | Load `.xor_c`, a compact GPU-side XOR prefilter. Repeatable |
| `-xuc FILE` | Load `.xor_uc`, an even smaller GPU-side XOR prefilter. Repeatable |
| `-xh FILE` | Load `.xor_hc`, the smallest GPU-side XOR prefilter. Repeatable |
| `-xx FILE` | CPU verify using an uncompressed `.xor_u` filter |
| `-xb FILE` | CPU verify with Bloom filter |

`-hash` is a hex input. For classic hash160-based families you usually provide the full 20-byte value. For raw 32-byte targets, the tool consumes a hex prefix, so you typically pass the leading bytes of the raw value.

Target-oriented `-hash` guidance:

- `-c c`, `-c u`, `-c s`, `-c r` expect Bitcoin-style `hash160` in hex.
- `-c x` expects the leading bytes of the raw x-only public key in hex, without `02`, `03`, or `04`.
- `-c e` expects the Ethereum address in hex, without `0x`.
- `-c S` expects the leading bytes of the raw ed25519 public key in hex, which means the Solana address must be decoded from base58 first.
- `-c t` and `-c T` expect the leading bytes of the raw TON account hash in hex, without the `<workchain:>` prefix.

Practical BTC-style exact hash example:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery "adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny burst *" -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Bloom filters

`CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery` accepts Bloom filters compatible with the formats used by [brainflayer](https://github.com/ryancdotorg/brainflayer) and [Mnemonic_CPP](https://github.com/XopMC/Mnemonic_CPP).

You can add several Bloom filters by repeating `-bf`:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -bf wallet_a.blf -bf wallet_b.blf -c c
```

## XOR Filters and XorFilter

If you want XOR filters for this project, generate them with [XorFilter](https://github.com/XopMC/XorFilter).

Recommended workflow:

- `.xor_u` is the only XOR format recommended for a full standalone run without extra CPU confirmation.
- `.xor_c`, `.xor_uc`, and `.xor_hc` are compact GPU prefilters. They are excellent for reducing memory and accelerating broad scans, but they should not be treated as the final truth in a full recovery session.
- For `.xor_c`, `.xor_uc`, and `.xor_hc`, add `-xx wallet.xor_u` so the survivors are rechecked on the CPU against an uncompressed `.xor_u` filter.
- You can load several XOR filters of the same family by repeating the corresponding flag.

Practical example:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -xc wallet.xor_c -xx wallet.xor_u -c cus
```

Multi-filter example:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -xc wallet_a.xor_c -xc wallet_b.xor_c -xx wallet_master.xor_u -c cus
```

That pattern gives you a compact GPU filter on the front end and a precise CPU re-check on the back end.

### Runtime and output

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-pbkdf N` | Override PBKDF2 iteration count. Default: `2048` |
| `-pass VALUE\|FILE` | Use one passphrase string or a passphrase file |
| `-device LIST` | Use one or more GPUs, for example `2`, `2,3`, `0-3` |
| `-b N` | Force CUDA blocks |
| `-t N` | Force CUDA threads per block |
| `-fsize N` | Found-buffer capacity |
| `-o FILE` | Output file. Default: `result.txt` |
| `-save` | Save address-oriented output instead of raw match hash |
| `-silent` | Suppress console hit printing |
| `-h`, `-help` | Show public help |

## Understanding `-save`

The tool keeps compact colon-separated `Found` lines.

Without `-save`, the last field is the raw matched hash/target bytes:

```text
[!] Found: <mnemonic>:<derivation>:<private_key_hex>:COMPRESSED:<matched_hash>
```

With `-save`, the last field becomes the address-oriented output instead:

```text
[!] Found: <mnemonic>:<derivation>:<private_key_hex>:COMPRESSED:<address>
```

What stays the same:

- the private key is still written
- the derivation path is still written
- the coin/type label is still written

What changes:

- raw hash output becomes address-oriented output
- compressed Bitcoin emits an additional `P2WPKH` line

Examples:

```text
[!] Found: ...:COMPRESSED:1LqBGSKuX5yYUonjxT5qGfpUsXKYYWeabA
[!] Found: ...:P2WPKH:bc1qmxrw6qdh5g3ztfcwm0et5l8mvws4eva24kmp8m
[!] Found: ...:ETH:0x9858effd232b4033e47d90003d41ec34ecaeda94
[!] Found: ...:SOLANA:EHqmfkN89RJ7Y33CXM6uCzhVeuywHoJXZZLszBHHZy7o
```

In mixed derivation runs, non-default derivation engines are annotated next to the derivation path, not in the coin label:

```text
[!] Found: ...:(bip32-secp256k1) m/44'/501'/0'/0':<private_key>:SOLANA:<value>
```

## Multi-GPU

Multi-GPU mode is enabled through `-device LIST`.

Examples:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2,3 -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 0-3 -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c cusrxeStT
```

What the tool does in multi-GPU mode:

- initializes one active worker context per selected GPU
- splits the recovery workload across devices
- keeps per-device accounting
- aggregates final tested / checksum-valid totals
- keeps async save workers alive until the end of the run

### Benchmark summary

Full methodology, fixture details, run conditions, and stress-case notes live in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](./BENCHMARKS.md).

Short local summary from the current benchmark set:

| GPUs | Devices | Workload | Time to first hit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `2` | `1 template`, `3 missing words`, exact hash | `550.07 s` |
| `2` | `0,2` | same | `211.58 s` |
| `4` | `0,1,2,3` | same | `41.59 s` |

Stress-case summary:

- `1 GPU`, device `2`, `4 missing words`, `10 minute` limit: no hit within `600.37 s`
- `4 GPU`, devices `0,1,2,3`, same stress fixture: first hit in `15.75 s`

For the exact commands, fixture files, hardware notes, repeated-run policy, and measurement boundaries, see [`BENCHMARKS.md`](./BENCHMARKS.md).

## Troubleshooting

### The tool says `-d FILE is required`

That is expected. Public documentation assumes explicit derivation files for recovery runs.

### I want to recover from a file instead of typing the phrase

Use:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt
```

### My wallet uses unusual derivation logic

Try `-d_type`:

- `-d_type 1` for forced BIP32/secp256k1
- `-d_type 2` for forced SLIP-0010 ed25519
- `-d_type 3` to try both
- `-d_type 4` for experimental `ed25519-bip32` checks only

### `-save` does not show the raw hash anymore

That is by design. `-save` switches the last field to address-oriented output.

### Can I use several GPUs?

Yes. Use `-device LIST`, for example:

```bash
-device 2,3
-device 0-3
```

`CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery` — это узкоспециализированный CUDA-инструмент для одной конкретной задачи: восстановления неполных BIP39 mnemonic-фраз с реальной проверкой кандидатов по нужным целям.

Он рассчитан на практическую работу: реальные wildcard-шаблоны, реальные derivation-path’ы, реальные фильтры, реальные MultiGPU-запуски и вывод, который остаётся удобным даже в длинной сессии восстановления.

## Для Чего Этот Проект

- У вас есть реальная BIP39-фраза, где часть слов потеряна и заменена на `*`.
- Вы хотите проверять кандидатов не вручную, а по реальному `-hash`, Bloom/XOR-фильтрам или CPU verify.
- Вам нужен один recovery flow для Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana и TON.
- Вам нужна MultiGPU-поддержка в понятном и сфокусированном recovery workflow.

## Что Умеет Проект

- Восстанавливать BIP39-фразы с пропущенными словами `*`.
- Работать с фразами длиной от `3` до `48` слов, если общее число слов кратно `3`.
- Использовать встроенные словари BIP39 или внешний `-wordlist FILE`.
- Автоматически подбирать подходящий языковой BIP39-словарь и исправлять типичные опечатки в словах, когда нужное слово определяется однозначно.
- Принимать шаблоны как из командной строки, так и из файлов.
- Проверять кандидатов по `-hash`, Bloom-фильтрам, XOR-фильтрам и optional CPU verify.
- Создавать XOR-фильтры с помощью [XorFilter](https://github.com/XopMC/XorFilter) и сразу использовать их в recovery flow.
- Работать с target-семействами Bitcoin-like, Ethereum, Solana и TON.
- Переопределять тип derivation через `-d_type`, если кошелёк использует не стандартную схему.
- Работать на одной GPU или сразу на нескольких.
- Получать компактный и практичный `Found` вывод, удобный для длинных recovery-сессий.

## Поддерживаемые Target Families

`-c` задаёт, какие именно целевые семейства нужно строить и проверять.

| Буква | Семейство | Что обычно получается |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `c` | Compressed | Bitcoin compressed address / hash160 |
| `u` | Uncompressed | Legacy uncompressed address / hash160 |
| `s` | SegWit | P2SH-wrapped SegWit style output |
| `r` | Taproot | Bech32m taproot output |
| `x` | XPoint | X-only/public point style match |
| `e` | Ethereum | Ethereum address / hash |
| `S` | Solana | Solana public address / raw target |
| `t` | TON | Базовый sweep по TON |
| `T` | TON-all | Расширенный sweep по TON |

Любые другие буквы в `-c` в публичной версии отвергаются.

GitHub Actions подготавливает два дистрибутивных архива:

- `CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery-windows-builds.zip`
- `CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery-linux-builds.tar.gz`

В Linux-архиве лежат такие профили:

| Профиль | Для каких карт | Примечание |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sm_61-dlto` | GTX 10xx / Pascal | Отдельная Linux-сборка для Pascal |
| `sm_75-dlto` | RTX 20xx / Turing | Лучший выбор для RTX 20xx под Linux |
| `sm_86-dlto` | RTX 30xx / Ampere | Отдельная Linux-сборка под Ampere |
| `sm_89-dlto` | RTX 40xx / Ada | Отдельная Linux-сборка под Ada |
| `sm_120-dlto` | RTX 50xx / Blackwell | Отдельная Linux-сборка под Blackwell |
| `universal-sm_86-sm_120` | RTX 30xx / 40xx / 50xx | Один Linux-бинарник для `sm_86`...`sm_120` |

В Windows-архиве лежат такие профили:

| Профиль | Для каких карт | Примечание |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sm_61` | GTX 10xx / Pascal | Отдельная Windows-сборка для Pascal |
| `sm_75` | RTX 20xx / Turing | Лучший выбор для RTX 20xx под Windows |
| `sm_86` | RTX 30xx / Ampere | Отдельная Windows-сборка под Ampere |
| `sm_89` | RTX 40xx / Ada | Отдельная Windows-сборка под Ada |

| `universal-sm_86-sm_120` | RTX 30xx / 40xx / 50xx | Один Windows-бинарник для `sm_86`...`sm_120` |

Release-сборки делаются на CUDA `12.8`. Если нужен максимально подходящий вариант под одно поколение GPU, берите dedicated-профиль. Если нужен один бинарник для современных карт, выбирайте `universal-sm_86-sm_120` для RTX `30xx`...`50xx`. Для RTX `20xx` остаётся отдельный профиль `sm_75`.

Пакеты подготовлены так, чтобы их было удобно переносить между машинами. Совместимый NVIDIA driver на целевой машине всё равно обязателен.

## Быстрый Старт

Первые команды ниже используют один и тот же exact-hash fixture из репозитория, так что их можно воспроизвести как есть.

### Восстановление одного пропущенного слова из командной строки

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery "adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny burst *" -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Восстановление из файла с шаблонами

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Проверка по реальному точному hash target

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery "* * alert human kiwi rough pottery level * funny burst divorce" -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Проверка через XOR filter

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -xc wallet.xor_c -xx wallet.xor_u -c cus
```

### Recovery с passphrase из файла

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -pass examples/passphrases.txt -c e
```

### Проверка Solana через BTC-style derivation

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c S -d_type 1
```

## Форматы Входных Файлов

### Файл шаблонов восстановления

Каждая строка — это один mnemonic-шаблон. Пропущенные слова помечаются как `*`.

Пример: [`examples/templates.txt`](./examples/templates.txt)

```text
adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny burst *
adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny * *
```

Правила:

- одна фраза на строку
- слова разделяются пробелами
- каждый неизвестный слот — это отдельный `*`
- строка должна выглядеть как обычная mnemonic-фраза, только с заменой неизвестных слов на `*`
- допустимая длина фразы — от `3` до `48` слов, при этом число слов должно быть кратно `3`
- инструмент автоматически подбирает подходящий языковой BIP39-словарь
- парсер умеет исправлять типичные опечатки, если нужное слово определяется однозначно

### Файл derivation-path’ов

Каждая строка — это один derivation path.

Пример: [`examples/derivations/default.txt`](./examples/derivations/default.txt)

```text
m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
m/49'/0'/0'/0/0
m/84'/0'/0'/0/0
m/86'/0'/0'/0/0
m/44'/60'/0'/0/0
m/44'/501'/0'/0'
m/44'/607'/0'/0/0
```

### Файл passphrase

Каждая строка — это одна passphrase.

Пример: [`examples/passphrases.txt`](./examples/passphrases.txt)

```text
TREZOR
wallet-passphrase-example
```

## Справка По Аргументам

### Источники recovery-входа

| Аргумент | Что делает | Примечание |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-recovery "..."` | Добавляет один шаблон прямо из CLI | Можно повторять |
| `-recovery -i FILE` | Загружает шаблоны из файла | Можно повторять |
| `-wordlist FILE` | Подменяет встроенный словарь BIP39 | Должен быть корректный 2048-word BIP39 список |
| `-d FILE` | Загружает derivation-path’ы | Обязательный аргумент |

### Цели и тип derivation

| Аргумент | Что делает |
| --- | --- |
| `-c TYPES` | Выбор target families. По умолчанию `cus` |
| `-d_type <1/2/3/4>` | Переопределяет derivation engine: `1=bip32-secp256k1`, `2=slip0010-ed25519`, `3=оба варианта`, `4=ed25519-bip32 (experimental)` |

Если `-d_type` не указан, инструмент использует обычный тип derivation для выбранной target family:

- Bitcoin-подобные и Ethereum-цели идут через обычный BIP32/secp256k1
- Solana и TON используют свой привычный ed25519-ориентированный тип derivation
- `-c` при этом всё равно задаёт именно target family, которую нужно строить и проверять
- `-d_type 4` включается только явно и не входит в mixed-режим
- В live status показываются и `candidates/s`, и `hashes/s`; hash throughput растёт вместе с числом derivations, выбранных целей и derivation policy

### Experimental `-d_type 4`

`-d_type 4` оставляет `ed25519-bip32` доступным как режим для отдельной оценки и проверки.

- Он включается только явно.
- Он не входит в `-d_type 3`.
- Он не входит в основные production-claims этого README.
- Отдельное покрытие для этого режима зафиксировано в [`VALIDATION.md`](./VALIDATION.md).

### Filters и direct targets

| Аргумент | Что делает |
| --- | --- |
| `-hash HEX` | Проверка по точному hash или raw target prefix в hex |
| `-bf FILE` | Загружает Bloom filter. Аргумент можно повторять |
| `-xu FILE` | Загружает `.xor_u`, несжатый формат XOR filter. Аргумент можно повторять |
| `-xc FILE` | Загружает `.xor_c`, компактный GPU-side XOR prefilter. Аргумент можно повторять |
| `-xuc FILE` | Загружает `.xor_uc`, ещё более компактный GPU-side XOR prefilter. Аргумент можно повторять |
| `-xh FILE` | Загружает `.xor_hc`, самый компактный GPU-side XOR prefilter. Аргумент можно повторять |
| `-xx FILE` | CPU verify через несжатый `.xor_u` filter |
| `-xb FILE` | CPU verify через Bloom filter |

`-hash` принимает hex-строку. Для classic hash160-семейств обычно используется весь 20-byte hash. Для raw 32-byte targets инструмент работает как prefix matcher, поэтому обычно передаются начальные байты raw значения.

Практическая подсказка по `-hash` для `-c`:

- `-c c`, `-c u`, `-c s`, `-c r` ждут Bitcoin-style `hash160` в hex.
- `-c x` ждёт начальные байты raw x-only публичного ключа в hex, без `02`, `03` и `04`.
- `-c e` ждёт Ethereum address в hex без `0x`.
- `-c S` ждёт начальные байты raw ed25519 public key в hex, то есть Solana-адрес нужно сначала декодировать из base58.
- `-c t` и `-c T` ждут начальные байты raw TON account hash в hex, без `<workchain:>`.

Практический BTC-style пример с точным hash:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2 -recovery "adapt access alert human kiwi rough pottery level soon funny burst *" -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c -hash 1a4603d1ff9121515d02a6fee37c20829ca522b0
```

### Bloom filters

`CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery` принимает Bloom-фильтры, совместимые с форматами, которые используют [brainflayer](https://github.com/ryancdotorg/brainflayer) и [Mnemonic_CPP](https://github.com/XopMC/Mnemonic_CPP).

Можно подключать несколько Bloom-фильтров, просто повторяя `-bf`:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -bf wallet_a.blf -bf wallet_b.blf -c c
```

## XOR Фильтры И XorFilter

Если вам нужны XOR-фильтры для этого проекта, создавать их лучше через [XorFilter](https://github.com/XopMC/XorFilter).

Рекомендуемая схема:

- `.xor_u` — единственный XOR-формат, который подходит как финальный standalone-вариант без дополнительной CPU-проверки.
- `.xor_c`, `.xor_uc` и `.xor_hc` — это компактные GPU-side prefilter’ы. Они отлично подходят для экономии памяти и ускорения широкого сканирования, но их нельзя считать финальной истиной в полноценной recovery-сессии.
- Для `.xor_c`, `.xor_uc` и `.xor_hc` добавляйте `-xx wallet.xor_u`, чтобы прошедшие кандидаты перепроверялись на CPU по несжатому `.xor_u`.
- Несколько XOR-фильтров одного семейства можно подключать повторением соответствующего флага.

Практический пример:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -xc wallet.xor_c -xx wallet.xor_u -c cus
```

Пример с несколькими XOR-фильтрами:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -xc wallet_a.xor_c -xc wallet_b.xor_c -xx wallet_master.xor_u -c cus
```

Такой шаблон даёт компактный GPU-фильтр на входе и точную CPU-перепроверку на выходе.

### Runtime и вывод

| Аргумент | Что делает |
| --- | --- |
| `-pbkdf N` | Переопределяет число PBKDF2 итераций. По умолчанию `2048` |
| `-pass VALUE\|FILE` | Одна passphrase строкой или файл passphrase |
| `-device LIST` | Выбор одной или нескольких GPU, например `2`, `2,3`, `0-3` |
| `-b N` | Принудительное число CUDA blocks |
| `-t N` | Принудительное число threads per block |
| `-fsize N` | Размер found-buffer |
| `-o FILE` | Файл результатов. По умолчанию `result.txt` |
| `-save` | Переключает последний столбец с raw hash на адресный вывод |
| `-silent` | Не печатать hits в консоль |
| `-h`, `-help` | Показать публичное help-меню |

## Как Работает `-save`

Инструмент сохраняет компактные `Found` строки в плоском формате через `:`.

Без `-save` последний сегмент строки — это raw matched hash/target bytes:

```text
[!] Found: <mnemonic>:<derivation>:<private_key_hex>:COMPRESSED:<matched_hash>
```

С `-save` последний сегмент становится адресно-ориентированным:

```text
[!] Found: <mnemonic>:<derivation>:<private_key_hex>:COMPRESSED:<address>
```

Что остаётся всегда:

- приватный ключ
- путь деривации
- label типа/монеты

Что меняется:

- raw hash заменяется на адресный вывод
- для compressed Bitcoin добавляется дополнительная строка `P2WPKH`

Примеры:

```text
[!] Found: ...:COMPRESSED:1LqBGSKuX5yYUonjxT5qGfpUsXKYYWeabA
[!] Found: ...:P2WPKH:bc1qmxrw6qdh5g3ztfcwm0et5l8mvws4eva24kmp8m
[!] Found: ...:ETH:0x9858effd232b4033e47d90003d41ec34ecaeda94
[!] Found: ...:SOLANA:EHqmfkN89RJ7Y33CXM6uCzhVeuywHoJXZZLszBHHZy7o
```

В mixed-режиме non-default derivation engine помечается рядом с derivation path, а не внутри названия монеты:

```text
[!] Found: ...:(bip32-secp256k1) m/44'/501'/0'/0':<private_key>:SOLANA:<value>
```

## Multi-GPU

Multi-GPU включается через `-device LIST`.

Примеры:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 2,3 -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c c
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -device 0-3 -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt -c cusrxeStT
```

Что делает инструмент в multi-GPU режиме:

- создаёт отдельный рабочий контекст на каждую выбранную GPU
- делит workload между устройствами
- ведёт per-device статистику
- агрегирует итоговые tested / checksum-valid totals
- сохраняет async save workers до конца выполнения

### Краткий benchmark summary

Полная benchmark-методика, описание fixture’ов, условия запуска и stress-case notes вынесены в [`BENCHMARKS.md`](./BENCHMARKS.md).

Короткая локальная сводка из текущего benchmark-набора:

| GPU | Устройства | Нагрузка | Время до первого hit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `2` | `1 шаблон`, `3 пропущенных слова`, exact hash | `550.07 s` |
| `2` | `0,2` | то же самое | `211.58 s` |
| `4` | `0,1,2,3` | то же самое | `41.59 s` |

Stress-case summary:

- `1 GPU`, устройство `2`, `4 пропущенных слова`, лимит `10 минут`: hit не найден за `600.37 s`
- `4 GPU`, устройства `0,1,2,3`, тот же stress-fixture: первый hit через `15.75 s`

За точными командами, fixture-файлами, оговорками по hardware и границами измерений см. [`BENCHMARKS.md`](./BENCHMARKS.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Инструмент пишет `-d FILE is required`

Это ожидаемо. В публичной документации recovery-запуски всегда предполагают явный файл с derivation-path’ами.

### Я хочу восстанавливать из файла, а не печатать phrase вручную

Используйте:

```bash
CUDA_Mnemonic_Recovery -recovery -i examples/templates.txt -d examples/derivations/default.txt
```

### У моего кошелька необычная derivation-логика

Пробуйте `-d_type`:

- `-d_type 1` — принудительный BIP32/secp256k1
- `-d_type 2` — принудительный SLIP-0010 ed25519
- `-d_type 3` — оба варианта
- `-d_type 4` — экспериментальный `ed25519-bip32` test-режим

### С `-save` перестал показываться raw hash

Это нормально. `-save` специально переключает последний сегмент на адресный вывод.

### Можно ли использовать несколько GPU?

Да. Например:

```bash
-device 2,3
-device 0-3
```
